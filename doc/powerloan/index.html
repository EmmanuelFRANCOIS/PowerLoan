        <article><h1>PowerLoan</h1>

<strong>PowerLoan</strong> library is organized into three main packages: common, simple, and advanced, each containing functions tailored to different levels of calculation complexity.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>two classes ready for use : <strong>simpleLoan</strong> and <strong>advancedLoan</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>simpleLoan</strong> class implement basic loan properties : capital, duration, interest type and rate, repayment periodicity and amount...</li>
<li><strong>advancedLoan</strong> class implement advanced loan properties : capital borrowed and releases, duration, interest type and rate, fees, insurance, repayment delay, periodicity and amount, early repayment...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>class <strong>members</strong> (properties) with default values and validation</li>
<li>many <strong>internal automatic calculations</strong> to simplify library usage and implementation</li>
<li>complete set of <strong>simple and advanced Loan calculations</strong></li>
<li><strong>modular architecture</strong> :
<ul>
<li>allowing for easy integration and customization</li>
<li>built with <strong>ESM (ES Modules)</strong> ready for tree shaking and bundle size optimization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>high precision calculations using <strong>big.js</strong> library</li>
<li>extensive date manipulation capabilities with <strong>Day.js</strong> library</li>
<li>fully tested with automated <strong>unit testing</strong> (thanks to Jest)</li>
<li>fully <strong>documented</strong> (thanks to JSDoc)</li>
<li>published on <strong>NPM</strong> to be integrated in web or mobile Javascript apps</li>
</ul>
<h2>Warning - Missing advanced features</h2>
<p>I decided to publish <strong>PowerLoan</strong> on GitHub and NPM to offer to beginning developers an example as complete and well organized as possible, as a starting point or template to help them build their own JS libraries.</p>
<p>However, I'm building <strong>PowerLoan</strong> library mainly to be used by my <strong>MyLoans</strong> web and mobile app.</p>
<p>And I want this <strong>MyLoans</strong> app to keep a competitive edge toward other loan calculation apps available on the web or on app stores.</p>
<p>This is the reason why :</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't provide <strong>AdvancedLoan class</strong> nor <strong>advanced functions</strong> code for now.</li>
<li>Only the <strong>powerLoan-light.js</strong> and <strong>powerLoan-light.min.js</strong> will be publicly available for now.
These packages include SimpleLoan class and common and simple loan calculation functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install <strong>PowerLoan-light</strong> using npm:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>npm install powerloan-light
</code></pre>
<p>Or using yarn:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>yarn add powerloan-light
</code></pre>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>PowerLoan</strong> full documentation has been automatically generated (thanks to JSDoc library) and is available into the &quot;doc&quot; folder.</p>
